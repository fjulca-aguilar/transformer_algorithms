# Formal algorithms for Transformers
Implementation of algorithms in the paper [Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238).

Implements the Encoder-Decoder, Encoder-only and Decoder-only Transformers, 
as described in the paper. The aim of this implementation is educational purposes.
The operations and notation follow the paper as much as possible.
